# Exploring the Socioeconomic Impacts of the 2021 Blackout in Houston, Texas

## Problem Statement

Estimate the number of homes in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storms during the Houston Blackouts. We will also investigate if socioeconomic factors are predictors of communities recovery from a power outage.

## Background

In February 2021, the state of Texas suffered a major power crisis, which came about as a result of three severe winter storms sweeping across the United States on February 10--11, 13--17, and 15--20."[^1] For more background, check out these [engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08mwXICY4JM&ab_channel=PracticalEngineering) and [political](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcrsgdl_hP0&ab_channel=Vox) perspectives.

## Data Sources

#### Night lights

Use NASA's Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.

VIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.

#### Roads

Typically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.

[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.Â  Typically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)).

#### Houses

We can also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.

#### Socioeconomic

We cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS ["file geodatabase"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file.

You can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt).

The geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use.

There are 3 steps to this analysis:

#### 1. Finding the locations of Blackouts

This analysis will be based on remotely-sensed night lights data, acquired from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Infrared_Imaging_Radiometer_Suite) onboard the Suomi satellite. In particular, we will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.

```{r, hide = TRUE, warning = FALSE, include=FALSE}
#find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm
#assume that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm-2sr-1 experienced a blackout
mask <- (Feb_7 - Feb_16) > 200

#assign NA to all locations that experienced a drop of less than 200 nW cm-2sr-1
mask[mask == FALSE] = NA
#use st_as_sf() to vectorize the blackout mask
blackout <- st_as_sf(mask)
#fix any invalid geometries using st_make_valid
blackout<- st_make_valid(blackout)
#turn these coordinates into a polygon using st_polygon
Houston <- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-96.5, 29),c(-96.5, 30.5),c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-94.5, 29),c(-96.5, 29))))
#convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using st_sfc() and assign a CRS
Houston <- st_sfc(Houston) %>% 
  st_set_crs(4326)
#crop (spatially subset) the blackout mask to our region of interest
cropped_mask<- st_crop(blackout,Houston)

#re-project the cropped blackout dataset to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area)
cropped_mask <- cropped_mask %>% 
  st_transform('EPSG:3083') %>% 
  st_make_valid()
#Use st_difference to select the areas that are within the cropped mask and outside the buffer
cropped_mask_no_highways <- st_difference(cropped_mask,highways_with_buffer)

#Use the plot function to visualize areas that experinced a blackout
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = cropped_mask_no_highways$geometry,color = 'orchid4')+
  labs(title = 'Locations that expeienced a Blackout',
       x = 'Longitude',
       y = 'Latitude')
```

#### 2. Find homes impacted by blackouts

To determine the number of homes that lost power, we will spatially join these areas with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) data on buildings and roads. To determine the number of homes that lost power, you link (spatially join) these areas with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) data on buildings and roads.

```{r, hide = TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Reproject the buildings data to be the same CRS
buildings <- buildings %>% 
  st_transform('EPSG:3083')
#Use st_within to select buildings that are within our blackout mask
homes_with_blackouts <- st_intersection(buildings,cropped_mask_no_highways)
#Find how many homes were affected
nhomes <- as.numeric(nrow(homes_with_blackouts))

print(paste('The number of homes that experienced blackouts is', nhomes, 'homes.'))

```

#### 3. Investigate socioeconomic factors

To investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, we will link this analysis with data from the US Census Bureau. To investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, we will link this analysis with data from the US Census Bureau. This data can be visualized from the following maps and plot.

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, hide = TRUE, include=FALSE}
#Transform the Houston Polygon to the same CRS as the census income info
Houston <- Houston %>% 
  st_transform('EPSG:3083')

# Use st_crop to crop the Texas Census Data to Houston Boundaries
census_houston <- st_crop(census_income, Houston)
#Combine the Census data with the blackout data, set available values equal to ture
combined <- st_join(census_houston, homes_with_blackouts, left = TRUE)
#Set the NA Values equal to False
combined$VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif[is.na(combined$VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif)] <- "FALSE" 
#Create a new variable to identify just the tracts that experienced blackouts
trac_with_blackout <- combined %>% 
  filter(combined$VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif == TRUE)
##Create a new variable to identify just the tracts that didnt experience blackouts
trac_without_blackout <- combined %>% 
  filter(combined$VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif == FALSE)
```

```{r}
#Create a map of median income by census tract, designating which tracts had blackouts
tm_shape(census_houston) + 
  tm_polygons("median_income", 
          title = "Median Income ($)",
          palette = "magma") +
  tm_title(text = "Map of Median Income with Blackouts Designated by Centroids")+
  tm_shape(trac_with_blackout) +
  tm_dots() 
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
  tm_shape(trac_with_blackout) +
  tm_polygons("median_income", 
          title = "Median Income ($)",
          palette = "RdPu") +
    tm_title(text = 'Median Income of Census Tracts that Experienced a Blackout')+
      tm_basemap(server = "OpenStreetMap")
```

```{r, messgae = FALSE}
  tm_shape(trac_without_blackout) +
  tm_polygons("median_income", 
          title = "Median Income ($)",
          palette = "RdPu") +
    tm_title(text = 'Median Income of Census Tracts that did not Experience a Blackout')+
      tm_basemap(server = "OpenStreetMap")
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(combined, aes(x=VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif, y=median_income))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x = "Experienced a Blackout",
       y = 'Median Income ($)',
       title = "Median Income spearated by Blackout Status")

```

## Conclusions

This distribution was originally surprising to me because I expected there to be some information about lower-income census tracts being affected by the blackouts. I noticed from this data that so many buildings were affected by the blackouts; they weren't based on income. The income from the census tracts that didn't experience a blackout was lower than the census tracts that did because so few census tracts avoided the blackouts. The main limitation that I could identify in this study is that the original data wasn't available in the same projection. In order to join the spatial data, we had to reproject the data, which required the use of the st_make_valid() function in a few places in order for the code to run. Ideally, we could find data that was available in the same projection, so the geometries were more consistent.

## Future Work

One of the most notable thigns about this blackout is that Houston is generally faily well prepared for Hot weather, but this proved their energy systems aren't resilient to extreme cold weather. I would be interested to see if power outages in Houston due to hot weather have a stronger socioeconomic component. I would also want to replicate this analysis for other cities during natural disasters.
