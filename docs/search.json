    "text": "A little bit about meâ€¦\nI am a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science degree. I recently graduated from the University of California, Davis, with a Bachelor of Science in Biological and Agricultural Engineering and a minor in Atmospheric Science. While at UC Davis, I worked with a team of undergraduate students to complete an 11-month capstone project for the College of Engineering. My team developed a solid-state fermentation bioreactor to scale up the production of protein-enriched animal feed from almond hulls. Outside of class, I enjoyed being active in the UC Davis community as President of the Society of Biological Engineers and Ambassador for the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering. I have continued my community involvement at UCSB as a Social Co-chair for the Womxn in Science and Engineering club and a MEDS Class Co-chair. My goal is to become a leader in the scientific community and create comprehensive climate models that contextualize the impacts of global climate change."
