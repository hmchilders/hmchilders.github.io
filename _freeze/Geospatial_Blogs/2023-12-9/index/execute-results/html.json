Gentry et al. mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, bottom depth .\n\nThis exercise uses suitable temperature and depth data for each Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the West Coast of the US to find the area that are best suited to developing marine aquaculture for several species of oysters.\n\nThis workflow is then expanded to create a function that can take in temperature and depth limits and produce graphs that show the area in square kilometers and the percentage of each EEZ that is suitable for that species' suitable conditions.\n\nThis repository also contains an R script with the finalized function inside.\n\n### Skills used in this workflow:\n\n-   Combining vector/raster data\n\n-   Re-sampling raster data\n\n-   Masking raster data\n\n-   Map algebra\n\n## Data\n\nTo download the data used for this project, check out the link in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hmchilders/Marine_Suitable_Zone_Calculation/tree/main)!\n\n#### Sea Surface Temperature\n\nWe will use average annual sea surface temperature (SST) from the years 2008 to 2012 to characterize the average sea surface temperature within the region. The data we are working with was originally generated from [NOAA's 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly v3.1](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php).\n\n#### Exclusive Economic Zones\n\nWe will be designating maritime boundaries using Exclusive Economic Zones off of the west coast of US from [Marineregions.org](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php).\n\n#### Bathymetry\n\nTo characterize the depth of the ocean we will use the [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area).[^1]\n\n[^1]: GEBCO Compilation Group (2022) GEBCO_2022 Grid (<doi:10.5285/e0f0bb80-ab44-2739-e053-6c86abc0289c>).\n\n## Workflow:\n\n### Import Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(devtools)\nlibrary(tmaptools)\nlibrary(maptiles)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Load Datasets\n\n#### Sea Surface Temperature\n\nRead in the SST Data using the `terra::rast()` function.

In this case the SST and depth data have slightly different resolutions, extents, and positions. We don't want to change the underlying depth data, so we will need to resample to match the SST data using the nearest neighbor approach.\n\n1.
